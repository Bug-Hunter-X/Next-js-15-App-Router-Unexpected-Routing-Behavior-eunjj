# Next.js 15 App Router Routing Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered in Next.js 15's App Router related to unexpected routing behavior.  The issue manifests as incorrect page rendering or application crashes when navigating between pages, particularly those involving dynamic routes or nested layouts.

## Bug Description

The original `index.js` file exhibits a simplified example, but the underlying problem can occur in more complex scenarios. The problem occurs under certain conditions, such as rapid navigation or specific route combinations, leading to inconsistent page rendering or unexpected errors.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing the routing configuration in the `app` directory to ensure all routes are correctly defined and that there are no conflicts. In some cases, adjustments to the layout structure or the use of specific `next/navigation` functions might be needed. This can involve addressing issues in the way data fetching is handled across different routes or components within the Next.js app directory structure. The `index.solution.js` demonstrates potential fixes, and further investigation may be required depending on the specific nature of the bug.
